// reverb and delay are useful.

// in practice, it is always good to have `mixer`.

// the mix has a loose-matching reference `~t..`

// it will match all the refs that begin with ~t
~t1: speed 4.0 >> seq 60 >> bd 0.1 >> mul 0.5

~t2: seq 33_33_ _33 33__33 _33
>> squsynth 0.01 0.3
>> lpf 1000.0 5.0
>> mul 0.1

o: mix ~t.. >> plate 0.1

// you can uncomment the mix chain out and try this
// hand-made delay

// ~o: mix ~t..
// main: ~o >> delayms 70 >> mul 0.9 >> add ~o
